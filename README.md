### Section 1: Data Cleaning

This section describes the process of reading data from various formats (CSV, TXT, XLS and URL) and its subsequent 
processing. The main goal is to combine the headers with the corresponding data and unify them into a single data set. 
Additionally, a technique is implemented to clean up missing values (NaN) by replacing them with defined values.
